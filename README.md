# Practice: Learn you node
In this repo, I practice my new node knowledge with learnyounode. 

My biggest challenge so far has been using the documentation to decipher new concepts and methods in a format that is new to me. As I progress, I find the format easier to work through, as it is with all of the things I have learned so far.    

These problems mirror some of the python algorithms I have already faced and challenge me to use my new knowledge of javascript syntax to solve some basic programming problems.
