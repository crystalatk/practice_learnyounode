# Practice: Learn you node
In this repo, new node knowledge is practiced with learnyounode. 

Biggest challenge: using the documentation to decipher new concepts and methods in a format that is new. 

These problems mirror some of the python algorithms already faced and challenge me to use my new knowledge of javascript syntax to solve some basic programming problems.
